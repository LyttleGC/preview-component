## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I knew this one would be quick, I just wanted to test my knowledge on one last HTML & CSS strict projects before throwing JS into the mix. I do need to work more with media queries, but overall this one was fun and I'm starting to get more comfrotable with CSS.
